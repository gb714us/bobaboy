		<p id="description">We are two UCI students who were first exposed to the greatness that is boba upon entering as freshmen. Once we had tasted its bobalicious-ness, our cravings cannot be satisfied purely by Ring Road's 2 dollar boba. Communicating with other students, we were met with similar responses - we would like to have boba anytime we desire; thus, we have decided to launch Moba Boba as the solution to the nationally growing thirst for boba. Let no one in the nation ever be without boba!</p>
